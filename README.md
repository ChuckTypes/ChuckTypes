<!--
**ChuckTypes/ChuckTypes** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 👨🏿‍💻 I’m currently working on completing courses on Kaggle
- 🐍 I’m currently learning Python
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ways to learn R & SQL for free
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm ambidextrous (except for writing)
